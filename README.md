# neuralnetwork
A simple neural network implementation.

#### Try running an example:

Train a neural network on the xor function:
```
python examples/example_xor.py
```
Test my pre-made neural network that I trained on the mnist dataset, it gets around 95% accuracy:
```
python examples/example_premade_mnist.py
```

Train a neural network on the mnist dataset for yourself (this will take a while!):
```
python examples/example_mnist.py
```
